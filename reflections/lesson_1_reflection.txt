    How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I realised that i could save myself a lot of time, by pin pointing the exact location of the bug i was looking for. I like this feature, it would proove to be very useful when i work on my main projects.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versios automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Its all about the file types and user requirements, Git saves multiple files in one commit, because the files can be inter dependent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows a history of all the commits on a particular file, while git diff helps to compare commits to see what changes have been made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I now feel like Superman

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use this POWER to build my android application, thats going to be viral.
